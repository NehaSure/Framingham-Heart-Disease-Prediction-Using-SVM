# Framingham-Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-SVM
This project predicts 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk using machine learning on the Framingham Heart Study dataset. Support Vector Machine (SVM) models were developed with proper feature selection, data scaling, class imbalance handling (class weighting and SMOTE), and model evaluation using accuracy, recall, and ROC AUC metrics.
